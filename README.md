Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent health condition impacting women during their reproductive years. It arises from hormonal imbalances, notably elevated levels of androgens, leading to
symptoms such as irregular menstrual cycles, ovarian cysts, infertility, and, in severe cases, complications like diabetes and heart disease. Detecting PCOS early is critical to mitigating its long-term effects
on health and fertility. This project leverages the power of deep learning to enable early and accurate
detection of PCOS by analyzing ultrasound images of ovaries. Using a dataset from Kaggle, which categorizes images into ”Infected” (with PCOS) and ”Not Infected” (healthy ovaries), a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) model is developed in PyTorch. CNNs are particularly well-suited for recognizing patterns in medical images, such as shapes and textures. Data augmentation techniques and optimization
algorithms are employed during training to enhance the model’s accuracy and reliability. Moreover, the
project integrates SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to provide interpretability by highlighting the
image regions influencing the model’s predictions. This ensures that the system is accurate and transparent, fostering trust among healthcare professionals. This project aims to provide an efficient, interpretable
solution for PCOS diagnosis by bridging AI and healthcare, thereby contributing to improved patient outcomes and advancing medical decision-making processes.
